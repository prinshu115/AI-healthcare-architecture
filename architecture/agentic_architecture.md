## Agentic Architecture

Agents are introduced only when orchestration logic becomes complex.

Typical roles:
- Planner: decides what needs to be done
- Executor: performs retrieval or analysis
- Validator: checks output quality
- Human reviewer: final authority

Agents do not replace clinicians.
They support structured reasoning and reduce cognitive load.
